This book begins by describing the process, principles, and tools you must master to build a custom application framework. It introduces the fundamental concepts of OSGi, and then shows you how to put OSGi to work building various types of frameworks that solve specific development problems.    OSGi is particularly useful for building frameworks that can be easily extended by developers to create domain-specific applications.

Together, they're an amazing combination.    Flexible Rails is a book about how to use Ruby on Rails and Adobe Flex to build next-generation rich Internet applications (RIAs). The book takes you to the leading edge of RIA development, presenting examples in Flex 3 and Rails 2.    This book is not an exhaustive Ruby on Rails tutorial, nor a Flex reference manual. (Adobe ships over 3000 pages of PDF reference documentation with Flex.) Instead, it's an extensive tutorial, developed iteratively, how to build an RIA using Flex and Rails together. You learn both the specific techniques you need to use Flex and Rails together as well as the development practices that make the combination especially powerful.    The example application built in the book is MIT-licensed, so readers can use it as the basis for their own applications.

Why is this open-source tool so popular  Because it automates a tedious task: persisting your Java objects to a relational database. The inevitable mismatch between your object-oriented code and the relational database requires you to write code that maps one to the other. This code is often complex, tedious and costly to develop. Hibernate does the mapping for you.    Not only that, Hibernate makes it easy. Positioned as a layer between your application and your database, Hibernate takes care of loading and saving of objects. Hibernate applications are cheaper, more portable, and more resilient to change. And they perform better than anything you are likely to develop yourself.    Hibernate in Action carefully explains the concepts you need, then gets you going. It builds on a single example to show you how to use Hibernate in practice, how to deal with concurrency and transactions, how to efficiently retrieve objects and use caching.

Anyone who has looked at the demos and gotten a taste of what Silverlight can do knows that Silverlight represents an entirely new level of rich web interface technology for Microsoft developers. With Silverlight 2, developers can use JavaScript, VB, C#, Python, and Ruby to build user-friendly, interactive, and visually-dazzling web applications that work in most major browsers.    Silverlight 2 in Action is the first book to cover Silverlight 2, a far more robust implementation of Silverlight than the current 1 release that supports only JavaScript. The much-anticipated 2 release adds powerful new features along with the ability to code in multiple languages and integrate your work with Visual Studio and the new Expression suite of tools. This book delivers real-world examples and in-depth walkthroughs to help you confidently enhance your web applications using Silverlight 2.    Silverlight 2 in Action devotes extensive coverage to flexible layout components, the extensible control model, the communication framework, and the data-binding features   all cornerstones of software development. Author and Microsoft MVP Chad Campbell also describes rich media and vivid graphical and animation features. The final chapters include a variety of Silverlight deployment scenarios.    In addition to the fundamentals of Silverlight, you'll be introduced to architectural components such as the Silverlight object model. The book addresses the developer/designer collaboration model Silverlight enables, showing the developer how to include the designer effectively in the project workflow. This model is illustrated throughout the examples.

Seam is rapidly capturing the interest of Java enterprise developers because of its focus on simplicity, ease of use, transparent integration, scalability, and developer choice.

It discusses the shortcomings of JSF, the challenges of using Java persistence in the web environment, and other common development roadblocks, then shows how Seam makes these problems just melt away. In covering Seam, the author doesn't just ask you to sprinkle annotations on your code and expect that you understand how it works. Instead, the author lays down the facts, shows you the steps, reveals the logic, and diagrams the flow, so that by the end of the book, you will not only have gained a deep understanding of Seam, but will also come away ready to teach the material to others.

It introduces a logical and physical module format, called a bundle, for explicitly structuring your application as a set of interconnected modules. OSGi lets you install, start, stop, update, or uninstall modules at execution time without taking down your entire system. In addition, OSGi defines a local service-oriented approach for creating applications out of loosely coupled components.

The Web is experiencing a new growth with an emphasis on rich, web-based applications. These applications can be difficult to build because they rely on JavaScript, which lacks the sophisticated object-oriented structures and static typing of Java, they are tricky to debug, and they require you to manage numerous browser inconsistencies.    In May of 2006 Google released the Google Web Toolkit. GWT enables developers to create Ajax applications in Java. With GWT, you can build your applications using a real object-oriented language and take advantage of Java tools like Eclipse that are already available. Instead of trying to bring tool support to Ajax, Google brought Ajax to a place where the tools already existed.    GWT in Action shows you how to take advantage of these exciting new tools.

So far, the only comprehensive documentation available about gnuplot is the online reference documentation, which makes it both hard to get started and almost impossible to get a complete overview over all of its features. If you've never tried gnuplot   or have found it tough to get your arms around   read on.    Gnuplot in Action is the first comprehensive introduction to gnuplot   from the basics to the power features and beyond. Besides providing a tutorial on gnuplot itself, it demonstrates how to apply and use gnuplot to extract intelligence from data. Particular attention is paid to tricky or poorly-explained areas. You will learn how to apply gnuplot to actual data analysis problems. This book looks at different types of graphs that can be generated with gnuplot and will discuss when and how to use them to extract actual information from data.    One of gnuplot's main advantages is that it requires no programming skills nor knowledge of advanced mathematical or statistical concepts. Gnuplot in Action assumes you have no previous knowledge of either gnuplot or statistics and data analysis. The books starts out with basic gnuplot concepts, then describes in depth how to get a graph ready for final presentation and to make it look \"just right\" by including arrows, labels, and other decorations.    Next the book looks at advanced concepts, such as multi-dimensional graphs and false-color plots   powerful features for special purposes. The author also describes advanced applications of gnuplot, such as how to script gnuplot so that it can run unattended as a batch job, and how to call gnuplot from within a CGI script to generate graphics for dynamic websites on demand.    Gnuplot in Action makes gnuplot easy for anyone who needs to do data analysis, but doesn't have an education in analytical tools and methods. It's perfect for DBAs, programmers, and performance engineers; business analysts and MBAs; and Six-Sigma Black Belts and process engineers.",status:"PUBLISH",authors:["Philipp K.

What happened  Will it regain its power and again drive economic growth as in the past     No.    That's the surprising conclusion reached by Erik Keller, a central player in the booming IT world of the 1990s. Driven by fear of being left behind, American corporations let IT grow until it reached one half of all corporate capital spending by the year 2000. Now, chastened by their spending failures, IT managers are converging on a new consensus: to exploit IT competitively they must use their smarts over big money.    This shift in thinking comes just as free, open-source software, low-cost international programming labor, and new technologies combine to make the new approach possible.    A former Research Fellow at Gartner, Keller had an insider's view of the irrational spending at many Fortune 500 companies, personally influencing billions of dollars of technology acquisitions.    In Technology Paradise Lost Keller describes how the new thinking is working inside some of the country's most complex and successful organizations, including Merrill Lynch, JetBlue, Harrah's, and Motorola which have cut IT spending to gain a competitive edge, and experienced marked gains to their bottom lines.    As it advances, the new IT think will cause further massive disruptions in the computer business, with fundamental changes in the ways software is developed, sold, and used. Efficiency of IT investment will grow as excess fat is squeezed out of IT salaries, software system costs, and consultants' fees.    In an unexpected twist, Keller argues that even as IT spending is reduced its importance for competitiveness will grow. Reduced spending does not mean IT has become a commodity.

New technologies and devices   not to mention higher user expectations   have greatly multiplied the complexity level of interface programming. Enter JavaFX.    JavaFX is a set of Java-based rich user interface technologies that sits atop the existing Java Standard and Micro Editions, making current Java packages readily accessible from the JavaFX environment. At its heart is JavaFX Script, an innovative, compiled, domain specific language. JavaFX Script boasts a declarative syntax where the code structure mirrors the structure of the interface. Related UI pieces are kept in one efficient bundle, not strewn across multiple locations. A simple coding model reduces code complexity while increasing productivity. The JavaFX-specific libraries for presentation and animation take advantage of JavaFX Script's unique language features.    JavaFX in Action is a hands-on tutorial that introduces and explores JavaFX through numerous bite-sized projects. The book provides a solid grounding in the JavaFX syntax and related APIs by showing you how to apply the key features of the JavaFX platform. You'll absorb the fundamentals of the technology while exploring the possibilities JavaFX open up for your designs.    Author Simon Morris helps you transform variables and operators into bouncing raindrops, brilliant colors, and dancing interface components. Below the chrome, you'll master techniques to make your applications more responsive and user friendly. You'll also learn how to interact with your existing Java code so you can give your old apps some new JavaFX sparkle.",status:"PUBLISH",authors:["Simon Morris"],categories:["Java"]},{title:"Entity Framework 4 in Action",isbn:"1935182188",pageCount:576,publishedDate:{$date:"2011-05-01T00:00:00.000-0700"},thumbnailUrl:"https://s3.amazonaws.com/AKIAJC5RLADLUMVRPFDQ.book-thumb-images/mostarda.jpg",shortDescription:"Microsoft Entity Framework in Action introduces the Entity Framework to developers working in .NET who already have some knowledge of ADO.NET.

OOram has been fine-tuned over a decade on hundreds of projects by Trygve Reenskaug and his collaborators. It is supported by available CASE tools, training, and consulting.    Working With Objects is the source on a method which takes an evolutionary step forward in object-oriented development practices. OOram adds the intuitively simple but powerful concept of a role to object-oriented models and methods. For example, imagine trying to describe a person as an object. The most effective way to do this would be to independently describe each of the roles that person adopts (parent, employee, and so on) and then define how the person supports them. These ideas form the heart of the OOram approach.    In a presentation rich with examples, Working With Objects is anything but the typical, dry methodology book. It tells real-life stories.

Unfortunately, it's not so easy to bring Agile into an existing organization with established people and practices. Becoming Agile shows you practical techniques and strategies to move from your existing process to an Agile process without starting from scratch.    Many books discuss Agile from a theoretical or academic perspective. Becoming Agile takes a different approach and focuses on explaining Agile from a ground-level point-of-view. Author Greg Smith, a certified ScrumMaster with dozens of Agile projects under his belt, presents Agile principles in the context of a case study that flows throughout the book.    Becoming Agile focuses on the importance of adapting Agile principles to the realities of your environment. While Agile purists have often discouraged a    partial-Agile    approach, the reality is that in many shops a    purist    approach simply isn't a viable option. Over the last few years, Agile authorities have begun to discover that the best deployments of Agile are often customized to the specific situation of a given company.  As well, Becoming Agile addresses the cultural realities of deploying Agile and how to deal with the needs of executives, managers, and the development team during migration. The author discusses employee motivation and establishing incentives that reward support of Agile techniques.    Becoming Agile will show you how to create a custom Agile process that supports the realities of your environment.
